# Photo Gallery App

An app where we expore the camera usage. We can open the device camera and display then pictures taken. We can also open the gallery from the app.

# Getting Started

1. Download the repo

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. For iOS

```
cd ios && pod install
```

## Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npx
npx react-native run-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npx
npx react-native run-ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
